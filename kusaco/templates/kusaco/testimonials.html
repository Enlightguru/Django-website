								"I joined KUSACO in 2012 and left in 2015 after my graduation that same year. I was the head of training and events programme. I work in Nation Media Group as an executive in Newspaper in Education. Through Kusaco I was lucky to be proffessionally trained as a Trainer of Trainees (TOT),thereafter formed Behaviour Change and Communication Groups(BCCG's) and enlightened fellow university students on health issues. This opportunity impacted so much in my previous and current careers. Having acquired certificates of TOT, Peer Counseling, Community service with other partners such as Red Cross, I had an upper hand than my fellow graduates in acquiring my first job in a mentorship company where I worked as a trainer.Currently i conduct training in schools on the impportance of using a newspaper in their studies and in return i sell a lot of copies. KUSACO has been a pillar in my career. Apart from the skills I learned to interact, share and also applaud other people's opinions. Long live KUSACO. VIVA!!"
